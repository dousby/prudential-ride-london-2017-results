# prudential-ride-london-2017-results
A quick R script to download the Prudential Ride London 100 2017 results into a csv. It should all be autonomous but getting the max number of result pages may cause issues so best to check. Some problems with parsing the club but this can be fixed if necessary.

First time trying anything like this so feedback welcome
